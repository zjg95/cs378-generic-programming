# Integer
Write a program to implement an arbitrary-precision integer and to compute the 20th Mersenne prime.


Implement it such that it works with a vector or deque as a backing container with each element representing a decimal digit.
The current largest known prime happens to be a Mersenne prime (a prime of the form 2n-1). There are only 48 known Mersenne primes.
There's a SETI-like effort, GIMPS, to find the next one.
You may not use new, delete, malloc() or free(). You may use the STL.
